                <p>The Constitution of the World Health Organization, which came into force on April 7, 1948, defined health 
                    “as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being.” 
                    The writers of the Constitution were clearly aware of the tendency of seeing health as a state dependent 
                    on the presence or absence of diseases: so they added to that definition that an individual, if he is to be considered healthy, 
                    should not suffer from any disease 
                    (….“and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”). 
                    In that way, the definition of the World Health Organization simply 
                    added a requirement to the previous position that allowed to declare someone healthy if no disease could 
                    be found: the step forward that could have been taken in the conceptualization of health as a dimension 
                    of existence which can co-exist with the presence of a disease or impairment was thus not taken.</p>

                  <p> Today, three types of definition of health seem to be possible and are used. 
                    The first is that health is the absence of any disease or impairment. 
                    The second is that health is a state that allows the individual to adequately cope with all demands of daily life 
                    (implying also the absence of disease and impairment). </p>

                   <p> The third definition states that health is a state of balance, an equilibrium 
                    thatan individual has established within himself and between himself and his social and physical environment.</p>
                   
                    <p>Eye diseases or disorders are of a wide variety. Cataract, glaucoma, 
                        refractive errors are major causes of visual impairment and preventable blindness. Cataract is the leading cause of blindness 
                        accounting for 66.2% cases of blindness, 
                        and 80.7% of cases of severe visual impairment followed by refractive error and glaucoma
